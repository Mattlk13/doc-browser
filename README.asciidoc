Doc Browser is an API documentation browser with support for DevDocs and Hoogle, written in Haskell and QML.

The GUI looks like this:

== Features

* Native desktop application
* Works offline
* Near real-time fuzzy search
* Easy-to-type shortcuts
* Hoogle integration
* Customizable (in progress)
* link:#http-interface[HTTP interfaces]
* link:https://github.com/qwfy/doc-browser-nvim[Neovim integration]. Editor integration is just a HTTP request away

== Current Status

It's in early stage, the main interface is in shape and usable, but
other aspects, like installing docsets and configuration, lack
polishing. That being said, I use this application every day.

== Installation

=== Arch Linux

There is a https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/doc-browser-git/[PKGBUILD]
available on AUR.

Please note, due to a restriction of stack, when invoking `doc-browser` from the command line, please prefix `doc_browser_datadir=/usr/share/doc-browser` to it, like this: `doc_browser_datadir=/usr/share/doc-browser doc-browser`, this ugly situation will be dealt with in the future version. Launching it using the `.desktop` file works correctly.

=== Other Linux Distros

Follow these steps to install from source:

1.  This application uses http://qt-project.org/[Qt 5], make sure you
have it installed. You also need https://wiki.qt.io/QtWebEngine[Qt
WebEngine], install it if it doesn't come with your Qt installation, on
Arch Linux, this is provided by the
https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/qt5-webengine/[extra/qt5-webengine]
package.
2.  Install the Haskell tool
https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/[stack].
3.  The build process depends on an executable called `c2hs`, you can
install it using your package manager, or use the instruction below.
4.  Install the executables `alex` and `happy` in a similar manner with
`c2hs`.

Finally, run these commands in the shell to build and install the
application:

[source,bash]
----
git clone 'https://github.com/qwfy/doc-browser.git'
cd doc-browser

# optionally, install `c2hs` if not already installed:
# stack install c2hs

stack install

echo "binary installed to $(stack path --local-bin)"
----

If you have trouble building this application, you can:

* Is it a dependency problem?
* Does http://www.gekkou.co.uk/software/hsqml/[this page] help?
Especially the _Requirements_ and _Installation_ section.
* Open an issue.

Optionally, install the executable `xsel` or `xclip` for the kbd:[Y] shortcut
(copy the selected match to clipboard) to work.

Optionally, install the executable `xdg-open` (provided by package
`xdg-utils` on Arch Linux) for the kbd:[Ctrl+/] shortcut (send query to
Google) to work.

=== Install DevDocs' Docset

To install DevDocs' docset, invoke:

[source,bash]
----
doc-browser --install-devdocs DOC1 DOC2
# e.g. doc-browser --install-devdocs python haskell
----

This will download docsets from devdocs.io, and unpack them to
`XDG_CONFIG/doc-browser/DevDocs`.

=== Enable Hoogle Support

To support Hoogle, this application creates a Hoogle database from a
documentation archive, which can be done by these steps:

1.  Find out which documentation archive you want to use. The Hoogle
support is tested on archives provided by
https://www.stackage.org[Stackage], like
https://s3.amazonaws.com/haddock.stackage.org/lts-10.8/bundle.tar.xz[this
one], which can be found at: https://www.stackage.org/lts-10.8. You can
use other archives as well, as long as the unpacked archive can be read
by `hoogle generate --local=dir_to_unpacked_archive`, but this is
untested.
2.  Invoke the following installation command, this will unpack the
archive to `XDG_CONFIG/doc-browser/Hoogle/COLLECTION`, and creates a Hoogle
database `XDG_CONFIG/doc-browser/Hoogle/COLLECTION.hoo` for it, (doc-browser's
Hoogle doesn't interfere with your system Hoogle in any way):

[source,bash]
----
doc-browser --install-hoogle URL COLLECTION
# e.g. doc-browser --install-hoogle 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/haddock.stackage.org/lts-10.8/bundle.tar.xz' lts-10.8
#
# URL is where to read the archive.
# It can also be a local file,
# which I suggest you to use if you have a bad network connection,
# since the download function included in this program is pretty savage at this stage.
#
# See `doc-browser --help` for more
#
# Don't panic if you see a lot of lines that look like this
# at the begining and the ending of the generation
# (for the above lts-10.8, there are 43 of these):
#
# temporarily relocate x to x.__co.aixon.docbrowser-tempfile__, for x in:
# /home/user/.config/doc-browser/Hoogle/lts-10.8/prologue.txt
# ...
# move x.__co.aixon.docbrowser-tempfile__ back to x, for x in:
# /home/user/.config/doc-browser/Hoogle/lts-10.8/prologue.txt
# ...
#
# These are necessary to work around a Hoogle issue.
----

1.  Prefix or suffix a search with "/hh" to query Hoogle, like this:
`/hh[a]->Int->[a]`.

=== Start the Application

If you installed the application from AUR, you can either start it with
the shipped .desktop file, or with:

[source,bash]
----
doc-browser
----

If you installed from source, start it with:

[source,bash]
----
doc-browser
----

== Offline Support

The documentation files themselves are downloaded to your disk when
`doc-browser --install-devdocs` or `doc-browser --install-hoogle` is
invoked, however, to display the documentation, some additional
Cascading Style Sh*t or JavaScript files are needed, some of these are
not packaged with the documentation files.

To make DevDocs' docsets work fully offline:

* Start the application after `doc-browser --install-devdocs`
* Search for anything, and open any match
* When the tab is opened and the documentation is correctly displayed,
all necessary files are cached, DevDocs' docsets work offline now

(Cache-when-installing will be implemented after session restore is
implemented.)

If a MathJax distribution is found at `/usr/share/mathjax`, then the
Hoogle documentations will work offline. (If you installed from AUR, you
already have it.)

== GUI

* When the application starts, you will see a blank screen, you can
start typing to search.
* Prefix or suffix a search string with "/py", (e.g. "/pyabspath",
"abspath/py"), will limit the search to the Python docset provided by
DevDocs, more commands are available, see below.
* Number of tabs will peak at 10, open one more tab will close the
left-most one.
* Various keyboard shortcuts are available, see below.

== Configuration

Create the file `XDG_CONFIG/doc-browser/config.yaml` and edit it.

The file is in YAML format, configurable keys and documentations can be
found at:

* `doc-browser --print-default-config`
* or `config.yaml` in the root of the source repository

The screenshot uses the font http://input.fontbureau.com/[Input Mono],
it is free for personal use, you can install and config doc browser to
use it.

== HTTP Interface

You can interact with this application using HTTP requests.

API documentation can be found at:

* https://qwfy.github.io/doc-browser/http-interface.md
* or, `doc-browser --print-api`

== Credits

This application is written by incomplete@aixon.co.

Many thanks to https://github.com/Thibaut[Thibaut Courouble] and
https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs/graphs/contributors[other
contributors] of https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs[DevDocs], without
their work, this application wouldn't be possible:

* This application ships with icons collected by DevDocs.
* This application uses docsets, along with the corresponding style
sheets, produced by DevDocs.

Many thanks to https://github.com/ndmitchell[Neil Mitchell] for the
great https://github.com/ndmitchell/hoogle[Hoogle]. The Hoogle support
receives https://github.com/qwfy/doc-browser/issues/2[helps] from him.
This application also ships with a little code from the Hoogle project,
the modified code is licensed under the BSD license.

For Hoogle support, this application guides user to download
documentation archive from https://www.stackage.org[Stackage].


== FAQ and Troubleshooting

Problem: On KDE, kbd:[Ctrl+/] is taking too long to open the browser.

Solution: This application uses `xdg-open` to open the browser. Try
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=364662#c3[this workaround].

Problem: The font in the documentation is too big or too small.

Solution: Tweak the configuration `WebEngineZoomFactor`, see the
link:#configuration[Configuration] section for instruction.

Problem: HTTP summon interface doesn't bring the window to front
Solution: Try the section _Additional settings for Linux_ described in
https://kb.froglogic.com/display/KB/Problem+-+Bringing+window+to+foreground+%28Qt%29[here].

Q: Why does this application display at most 27 matches?

A: If your desired match is not in the top 27 matches, then there is
probably something wrong with the search algorithm.

Q: Why does this application display at most 10 tabs?

A: If too many tabs are displayed, the tab title would be hard to see on
many monitors. Instead of wanting more tabs, try open another instance
of this application. The number of maximum tabs will be configurable in
future versions, so you can benefit from a large monitor.
