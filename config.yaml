# To configure this application, create the file
#   XDG_CONFIG/doc-browser/config.yaml
# which is usually
#   /home/<your user name>/.config/doc-browser/config.yaml
# and then edit the interested configurations there, you don't
# have to copy all keys to that file, just copy the keys you
# are interested in is sufficient.


# NOTE:
# Currently, unless otherwise stated,
# all configuration changes require a restart to take effect.
# Sorry for the trouble :(
