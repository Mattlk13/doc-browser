# To configure this application, create the file
#   XDG_CONFIG/doc-browser/config.yaml
# which is usually
#   /home/<your user name>/.config/doc-browser/config.yaml
# and then edit the interested configurations there, you don't
# have to copy all keys to that file, just copy the keys you
# are interested in is sufficient.


# NOTE:
# Currently, unless otherwise stated,
# all configuration changes require a restart to take effect.
# Sorry for the trouble :(


# Zoom factor for QtWebEngine.
# ============================================================
# If the font is too big or too small in the tab, tweak this:
# - if you don't have HiDPI, try 1
# - otherwise, try 1.5 or 2, or other values
WebEngineZoomFactor: 1.5


# Serve the documentation using this port.
# ============================================================
# Restart all instances of this application after changing,
# instances that are not restarted will continue to use the
# old port.
Port: 7701


# Customizable commands.
# ============================================================
# The "py" part in the query "/pyos.path" is called a command,
# you can use it to specify which docset you want to search.
#
# It has the same format as DefaultCommands, see there for
# the documentation and examples.
#
# Commands defined here will override those in
# DefaultCommands.
Commands: {}


# Do not change this, use Commands instead.
# ============================================================
# Commands are represented with YAML map, in this syntax:
#
#   <command string> : <command>
#        |                 |
#       \/                \/
# e.g.  py : ["LimitToDevDocs", "Python", "3"]
#
# <command string> must be two characters long, and cannot
# contain '/'.
#
# These <command>s are available:
#
# - ["LimitToDevDocs", "<collection>", "<version prefix>"]
#   This command limit the search scope to the docsets that
#   satisfies these conditions:
#
#   - it is provided by DevDocs
#   - its collection is <collection>
#   - <version prefix> is a case-insensitive prefix of the
#     docset's version
#
#   You can use `doc-browser --list-installed-devdocs` to
#   query installed collection and versions.
#
# - ["LimitToDash", "<collection>", "<version prefix>"]
#   Similar to "LimitToDevDocs", but this command search
#   docsets provided by Dash.
#
#   You can use `doc-browser --list-installed-dash` to
#   query installed collection and versions.
#
# - ["HoogleLatest"]
#   Search with Hoogle, use the "latest" database, where
#   "latest" is defined to be the last of:
#
#   sort_with_dictionary_order_ascending(all_collections)
#
# - ["HoogleLimit", <collection>]
#   Search with Hoogle, use the database specified by
#   <collection>.
